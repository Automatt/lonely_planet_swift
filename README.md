# Atlas
## iOS coding exercise

This is a very basic iOS project that uses bundled XML resources to display a list of places and provide a little content about each place.  It's a work in progress and a project just to play around a bit with Swift.

## Features

- Parses bundled XML to display list of places and content about each place
- Fetches high-res images for each place from Flickr
- Displays high res image in a 'stretchy' header with a mask

## Improvements to make

- Internal navigation to browse up and down heirarchy
- Use a page view controller to flip through the full size images
- Show each place on a map
- A way to browse all the places on a map
- Clickable links in content
