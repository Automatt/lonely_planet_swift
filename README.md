# Atlas
## iOS coding exercise

This is a very basic iOS project that uses bundled XML resources to display a list of places and provide a little content about each place.

## Improvements to make

This is just a work in progress and a place to play around with Swift.

- ~~Show more of available content for each place~~
- Internal navigation to browse up and down heirarchy
- ~~Pull a collection of images for each place from Flickr~~
- ~~Pull full size images, not just a thumbnail; Fix aspect~~
- ~~Add a stretchy header when dragged and photo title~~
- ~~Use a mask to make the header image more interesting and integrated with content~~
- Use a page view controller to flip through the full size images
- ~~More images of each place,~~ maybe use a collection view
- Show map element for each place
- Way to browse all places on a map
- Clickable links in content
