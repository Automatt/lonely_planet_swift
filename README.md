# Atlas
## iOS coding exercise

This is a very basic iOS project that uses bundled XML resources to display a list of places and provide a little content about each place.

## Improvements to make

This is just a work in progress and a place to play around with Swift.

- Show more of available content for each place
- Internal navigation to browse up and down heirarchy
- Pull an image for each place, maybe from Flickr
- Show map element for each place
- Way to browse all places on a map
